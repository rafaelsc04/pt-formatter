# Plain text formatter

Decided to create this because lately I've been writing a lot of things in plain
text files and adopted some standards to keep it readable and mantainable. I always
try to not exceed 80 characters per line and that's quite easy while writing, with
one command I can freely write with no worries so my editor will break it for me
when it comes to 80 characters. But the real deal comes when I have to fix something
or rewrite a part of the text, since it's new words, some lines might be left with
much free space or another exceed a little and for me to fix that by myself it's
just painfull.

If you want to change the amount of characters of limit (default 80), there is a
variable in the `main.py` file called 'limit', just change that value to what you
desire.
